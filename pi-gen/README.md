# README

This directory contains the custom config needed for building the Raspberry Pi OS custom image, with our own SSH key and some other small adjustments.

The config is valid for both, the 32Bit and 64Bit version of RPi OS.

This config is used for the automated build process for the image. Have a look at actions, if you want to learn more about the way the file is used.
